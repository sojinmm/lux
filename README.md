Lux is a powerful language-agnostic framework for building intelligent, adaptive, and collaborative multi-agent systems. It enables autonomous entities (Agents) to communicate, learn, and execute complex workflows while continuously improving through reflection.

## Why Lux?

- 🧠 **Self-Improving Agents**: Agents with built-in reflection capabilities (coming soon)
- 🚀 **Language Agnostic**: Build agents in your favorite programming language
- 🔄 **Type-Safe Communication**: Structured data flow with schema validation
- 🤖 **AI-First**: Deep LLM integration with advanced prompting and context management
- 🔌 **Extensible**: Easy integration with external services and APIs
- 📊 **Observable**: Built-in monitoring, metrics, and debugging tools
- 🧪 **Testable**: Comprehensive testing utilities for deterministic agent behavior

## Core Concepts

### 1. Agents 👻
[Learn more about Agents](lux/guides/agents.livemd)

Autonomous agents that combine intelligence and execution. Agents can:
- Monitor and analyze data
- Make strategic decisions
- Delegate tasks to other agents
- Adapt to changing conditions
- Collaborate through structured protocols

### 2. Signals 📡
[Learn more about Signals](lux/guides/signals.livemd)

Type-safe communication using predefined schemas. Signals provide:
- Structured data validation
- Type safety across language boundaries
- Clear communication protocols
- Versioning and compatibility

### 3. Prisms 🔮
[Learn more about Prisms](lux/guides/prisms.livemd)

Pure functional components for specific tasks. Prisms enable:
- Modular functionality
- Language-specific implementations
- Clear input/output contracts
- Easy testing and validation

### 4. Beams 🌟
[Learn more about Beams](lux/guides/beams.livemd)

Composable workflow orchestrators. Beams allow you to:
- Define complex workflows
- Coordinate multiple agents
- Handle parallel execution
- Manage state and dependencies

## Language Support

Lux provides first-class support for multiple programming languages:

- **Python**: Deep integration with Python's scientific and ML ecosystem
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Frontend and Node.js support
- **Other Languages**: Language-agnostic protocols for easy integration

### Using GitHub Codespaces

Lux supports development using GitHub Codespaces, providing a pre-configured development environment with all necessary dependencies.

#### Option 1: Using VS Code (Recommended for VS Code users)

The simplest way to get started with VS Code is through GitHub's native Codespaces integration:

1. Click the "Code" button on the GitHub repository
2. Select "Create codespace on main"
3. Wait for the environment to be created (this may take a few minutes)

For more information, see the [official GitHub Codespaces documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace).

#### Option 2: Using Cursor

For Cursor users, you'll need to set up SSH access to your Codespace as they currently do not support Codespaces directly. We provide a convenient setup script:

```bash
# Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x scripts/setup-codespace-ssh.sh

# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-codespace-ssh.sh

The script will:
1. Check for GitHub CLI installation and authentication
2. Let you create a new Codespace or select an existing one with customizable options:
   - Machine type (2-core to 16-core)
   - Geographic region for optimal latency
   - Git branch selection
3. Configure SSH access for Cursor
4. Set up a welcoming development environment
5. Provide clear instructions for connecting

Once complete, connect to your Codespace in Cursor:
1. Open Cursor
2. Press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P
3. Type 'Connect to Host'
4. Select your Codespace (it will be prefixed with 'codespaces-')

#### Development Environment Features

The Codespace comes with:
- VS Code extensions for Elixir, Python, and JavaScript development
- GitHub CLI
- asdf version manager
- All necessary development tools and plugins

When you first access the workspace:
- You'll be greeted with a welcome message showing available commands
- If it's a new codespace, development dependencies will be automatically installed
- The workspace will be ready at `/workspaces/lux`

The environment will automatically:
- Install development tools via asdf (based on .tool-versions)
- Install all Elixir dependencies for both Lux and LuxApp
- Set up a Python virtual environment
- Install required Python packages
- Configure VS Code settings for optimal development
- Install and configure Livebook

To set up the development environment:
1. Wait for the automatic tool installation (triggered when folder opens)
2. Open VS Code's Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
3. Type "Tasks: Run Build Task" and select it (or use Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + B)
4. This will run the "Initialize Environment" task which:
   - Installs Elixir dependencies for both Lux and LuxApp
   - Sets up Python virtual environment and dependencies
   - Installs Node.js dependencies
   - Installs and configures Livebook

To start the development servers:
1. Open VS Code's Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task" and select it
3. Choose "Start All Services" to launch both LuxApp and Livebook
4. Access:
   - LuxApp at port 4000
   - Livebook at port 4001 (no authentication required in dev mode)
   - Additional ports 8080 and 8081 are available for your services

Available Tasks:
Setup Tasks:
- "Initialize Environment" - Sets up all dependencies (default build task)
- "Install Development Tools" - Installs tools via asdf (runs automatically)
- "Install Elixir Dependencies" - Installs Lux dependencies
- "Install LuxApp Dependencies" - Installs LuxApp dependencies
- "Install Python Dependencies" - Sets up Python environment
- "Install Node.js Dependencies" - Installs Node.js packages
- "Install Livebook" - Installs Livebook

Service Tasks:
- "Start All Services" - Launches both servers (default test task)
- "Start LuxApp Server" - Starts only the Phoenix server
- "Start Livebook" - Starts only the Livebook server

For development:
- The main Lux library is in the `lux` directory
- LuxApp is in the `lux_app` directory
- Livebook notebooks can be created and run directly in the browser
- All necessary ports are automatically forwarded
- VS Code is configured for Elixir, Phoenix, and LiveView development
